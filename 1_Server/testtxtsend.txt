       If you add a filter or extend a current filter, please send it
       to driversweeper@phyxion.net.

       Files:
         - You can use wildcards: * , this will find everything
           matching the wildcard. You can use multiple wildcards
           at the same time.

         Example:

	   C:\Windows\System32\at*.*s
           will find all files matching the at*.*s phrase.

         - You can use all System Environment variables, like %Systemroot%.


       Registry:
         - If you want to remove a key in the registry, make sure
           the value you want to clean ends with a \ .
         - Values can be removed without a \ at end of value.

      	 Example:

	   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ATi Technologies\
           will detect the key ATi Technolgies.

           HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ATi Technologies\ATi
           will detect the value ATi.

       Directory:
